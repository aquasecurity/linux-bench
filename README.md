Linux-bench is a Go application that checks whether the Linux operating system is configured securely by running the checks documented in the CIS Distribution Independent Linux Benchmark.

Tests are configured with YAML files, making this tool easy to update as test specifications evolve.

## CIS Linux Benchmark support

linux-bench currently supports tests for benchmark version 1.1.0 only.

linux-bench will determine the test set to run on the host machine based on the following:
- **Operating system platform - ubuntu/debian/rhel/coreos**
- **Boot loader - grub/grub2**
- **System logging tool - rsyslog/syslog-ng**
- **Lsm - selinux/apparmor**

## Installation

go build -o linux-bench .

# See all supported options
./linux-bench --help

# Run checks
./linux-bench
